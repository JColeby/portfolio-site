                    Space travel is physically demanding and may have consequences on your health. Before the trip you will go through our state of the art medical exam to make sure you are all fit and ready for the trip.

                  <p>
                    For your space tour, you will need to go through specialized training to prepare for the empty void of space. There are zero-gravity tests and challenges, emergency procedures runthrough, and an explanation of the spaceship's systems and whereabouts.

                    In space there is not much extra room and will require you to pack light. Z-Space has a packing list for you to follow and anything extra will need to be approved by our experts.

                  It is necessary to get yourself familiar with the spaceship you'll be traveling in, its controls, emergency procedures, and the people you will be traveling with. Z-Space will have you go through and train on a replica of the ship multiple times to get yourself familiar with the ship before launch.

                Space travel is mentally challenging adventure. It is very important to prepare for the journey. We will have stress-management training to help everyone deal with the pressure of space.

          <h2>The Spaceship</h2>

          <p>
            Our Spaceship is made from the highest quality of heat-resistant materials, so re-entry will be smooth. The inside of the ship is a comfortable living space with a safe environment for you during the trip. Even with many spots to view Earth and the Moon during your trip.

        <h2>Launch Plan</h2>
        <p class="low-width">
          The launch plan for our rocket for space travel is a complex and carefully orchestrated process. But with our experts nothing will go wrong. We have many safety features to keep you safe. Here is the timeline of the launch day.
        </p>
        <p class="low-width">
          First, hours before launch go through the final preparations to make sure launch is ready to go. Then, we do a final check of the rocket's systems, fuel, and get you all ready to go. After that we finish up loading everything and load you onto the ship. Next we do one final check before launch. Thenâ€¦ Liftoff! You're heading into space.

        <h2>Recovery</h2>

          <p>
            The process of recovering you after your journey will be different for the different trips. For a space view you will come back to earth using a re-landing ship. There will be no need for any preparation for this type of recovery.
          </p>  
          <p>
            If you are going on a Lunar Orbit or a Mars Orbit you will fall back to Earth using parachutes and fall into the water. For this you will need training for the harsh re-entry. Even though it will be harsh, due to all our training you will be prepared for it. Whether a spaceship comes back to Earth depends on the type of spacecraft and the method of re-entry.
